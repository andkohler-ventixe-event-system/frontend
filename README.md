# React + Vite

Frontend for my school project Azure MVP.<br> 
Some minor help with AI on some places but not to much. Mostly for some sorting with "newest to oldest" and stuff like that. <br>
Some CSS help too on some parts but not much there. <br>
Toast message I got help with AI to setup. <br>
Displaying the date in the right format I wanted. <br>
The rating ring I also took help with AI to create and the animations for it in RatingSummary.jsx <br>

Most of the data for each event I thought of myself, I just used AI for a better description for most events.
