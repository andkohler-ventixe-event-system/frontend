# React + Vite

Frontend for my school project Azure MVP. Some minor help with AI on some places but not to much. Mostly for some sorting with "newest to oldest" and 
stuff like that. Some CSS help too on some parts but not much there.
Toast message I got help with AI to setup. Same with displaying the date in the right format I wanted.
The rating ring I also took help with AI to create and the animations for it in RatingSummary.jsx

Most of the data for each event I thought of myself, I just used AI for a better description for most events.
